## Team setting

Initially we wanted students to establish their team but it seems it did not work well. Either noteam was setup or a big team was proposed with "old friends". The deadline was missed so we decided to enforce a strictly rule:
* Team size
* Diversity: mixed students from different universities
* Gender balance: we put the rule that not two females are in the same team.

The change worked out so here for Asian students/Chinese students in this lecture, the instructors must not expected that students will highly actively engage each other.
