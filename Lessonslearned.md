# Lessons Learned and Comments

## Team setting

Initially we wanted students to establish their team but it seems it did not work well. Either no team was setup or a big team was proposed with "old friends". The deadline was missed so we decided to enforce a strictly rule:
* Team size
* Diversity: mixed students from different universities
* Gender balance: we put the rule that not two female students are in the same team.

The change worked out. Considering that Asian students/Chinese students tend to team with their (close) friends, in this lecture, the instructors must not expected that students will highly actively engage each other like in Western students.

## Language barriers
Students use English. However, it is quite challenging for some students to express their thoughts and technical designs clearly in English, as they are not used to this interaction style in advanced courses. Hence it requires not only the foreign instructor to have a lot of patience but also the local instructor to help students to articulate their ideas.

## Flexibility in the Program

During the lecture and the lab, we have observed issues and monitored progress of students in teamwork and in design complex services. It turned out that we need to give students much more time to understand the concept and work on the design. Furthermore, students also need to layout designs in the right way, this leads to the need to have time to work on right diagrams for service design, DevOps processes and technology choices. To accommodate these changes, we inserted various discussion slots during the courses based on specific situations.
