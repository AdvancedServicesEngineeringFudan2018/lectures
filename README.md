# Advanced Services Engineering, Summer 2018 for Fudan University

The Advanced Services Engineering (ASE) is a course lectured by [Hong-Linh Truong](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/truong) at [TU Wien](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/courses/ase/) since many years. This site includes lecture notes and other information about the ASE course carried out in Summer 2018 for Fudan University in the FIST program through the visiting professor of Hong-Linh Truong.

The ASE Course at Fudan University is jointly run by [Hong-Linh Truong](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/truong) and [Liang ZHANG (Leon)](http://www.cs.fudan.edu.vn/?page_id=2303).

**The key activities are: learn lecture materials, discuss topics, design software services, and coding the design everyday during the lecture period, following the devops and agile principles, resulting in not only knowledge gained but also a mini open-source prototype.**


The detailed program is [listed here](ase-fist2018-overview.pdf). The material for the course is mainly based on the previous ASE courses at TU Wien, with some customization and specific issues suitable for Fudan students.

# Lectures

## Lecture 1: Emerging distributed systems and challenges for services engineering


### Lecture content

We will discuss about challenges for services engineering given the emerging types of distributed systems and platforms. We especially look at real-world examples to learn the key elements of complex software services.

Download [the slides of the lecture](truong-ase-fudan-2018-lecture1-dss-challenges.pdf).

### Lab on identifying scenarios (requirements, datasets, and business models)

Students have to create their git project with basic readme file. They have to work on the high-level scenario of their mini project. Furthermore, they should be able to gather resources (existing cloud services, data sets, etc.) for they project.

All the information will be available in the git project. Here is [an example of the template for the scenario description](ase-scenario-template.pdf).

## Lecture 2: The role of IoT, Cloud systems, Blockchain and Machine Learning as a service
### Lecture content

We examine the role of clouds, IoT, machine learning and blockchain in a complex software service system and try to understand how we can leverage them for building complex software services.

### Lab: Lab on identifying application-specific services and platform services, presentation of scenarios and services

Students should be able to identify key application-specific services and platform services. They should be able to show their initial scenario and services. They should be aware that the scenario and its services will be evolved.

So what do we expect from this lab:

* Outline main building blocks of your scenario
* Outline platform services and application services
* Outline data and possible ways for having data for the scenario

These points can be described into a document about the design of the  scenario.

# Demo Day

The demo day will be 18 July 2018. Students will present project presentation and demonstrate their work.

# Student Projects

During the course, students will have to propose a mini project and implement the project within the course. The list of the [student project can be found here](https://github.com/AdvancedServicesEngineeringFudan2018). Several examples of previous ASE projects from other students can be found from http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/courses/ase/.

During the intensive schedule of the course, student projects are running like a hackathon: everyday students will have to code and update their git project incrementally. At the end of the course, we will run a demo session where we will see the project.
