# Advanced Services Engineering, Summer 2018 for Fudan University

The Advanced Services Engineering (ASE) is a course lectured by [Hong-Linh Truong](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/truong) at [TU Wien](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/courses/ase/) since many years. This site includes lecture notes and other information about the ASE course carried out in Summer 2018 for Fudan University in the FIST program through the visiting professor of Hong-Linh Truong.

The ASE Course at Fudan University is jointly run by [Hong-Linh Truong](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/staff/truong) and Liang ZHANG (Leon)().

The detailed program is [listed here](ase-fist2018-overview.pdf).

# Lectures

## Lecture 1: Emerging distributed systems and challenges for services engineering

### Lecture content

### Lab on identifying scenarios (requirements, datasets, and business models)

Students have to create their git project with basic readme file. They have to work on the high-level scenario of their mini project. Furthermore, they should be able to gather resources (existing cloud services, data sets, etc.) for they project.

All the information will be available in the git project. Here is an example of the template for the scenario description. 

## Lecture 2: The role of IoT, Cloud systems, Blockchain and Machine Learning as a service
### Lecture content

### Lab: Lab on identifying application-specific services and platform services, presentation of scenarios and services

Students should be able to identify key application-specific services and platform services. They should be able to show their initial scenario and services. They should be aware that the scenario and its services will be evovled. 

# Demo Day

The demo day will be 18 July 2018. Students will present project presentation and demonstrate their work.

# Student Projects

During the course, students will have to propose a mini project and implement the project within the course. The list of the [student project can be found here](https://github.com/AdvancedServicesEngineeringFudan2018). 

During the intensive schedule of the course, student projects are running like a hackathon: everyday students will have to code and update their git project increamentally. At the end of the course, we will run a demo session where we will see the project.
